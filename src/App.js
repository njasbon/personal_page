          <p>
            Iâ€™m a water polo lover, software engineer, basketball player, Colombian and Ecuadorian descendent born in Miami, Florida with a real itch to learn more. 
            My journey into development has been absolutely eye opening. I was a Biology Major at Connecticut College and I truly thought that I the only kind of job I would be any good at would be one as a nurse, physical therapist, etc. 
            So I studied to be a physical therapist. I enjoyed it, but it is really stressful and very hard on your body. After two years of applying I decided to take charge of my future. I started learning development thanks to my husband. 
            He encouraged me and I started meeting more and more people with stories like mine. Their stories spurred me on to focus on development, not for the money, but because coding is such a beautiful way to connect and create.
